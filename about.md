## Hello From the NetBit Quotient!

Some people may wonder why I would pick a word like Quotient so I figured I would put some details in about why.

First I already had the domain [NetBit.me](http://netbit.me) and I wanted to change my name on GitHub and while digging for a new one I found all I liked were taken.

I decided to try for a three letter with _nb*_ and the only one open was **nbq** and I knew I needed a good word that began with _Q_ and that is not easy!

I began to use my creative side and I just thought of **Quotient** which had this definition:
> a degree or amount of a specified quality or characteristic.

I knew then that since I care most about quality and charactoristics of code **(bits)**, it made the most sense.

Now we have the name, the platform and even something to write about from time to time.
