## Programming and how it relates to common sense

I originally planned this post to just be a simple intro post with the usual post about:
> I am Jason and I like computers!

## After the fact Intro to the Intro

As you can see, that is not what happened and now I will break down into how I see computer programming vs writing the text in this post.

## It Begins
Take this post, these words, in the form I am writing them... They are hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) but yet I am using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatting to write the formatting specifics to make how you see my [English Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) post show up prettier than basic text.

No matter what you write or how you say it, a language is put together in a way that someone or something on the other end can understand it. If you understand English then you can process what I am writing directly. Now what about Javascript, Objective-C, HTML and other programming languages? You are just learning how to write your words in a structure that something called a compiler can take and make it where the computer understands what to do with what you wrote.

This is where I break it down in my head and try to show people as I see it, programming in any language on a computer is nothing more than knowing how to write another language that generally does not have a spoken half but yet its is about speaking to a translator that uses what you say to it to pass onto your computer. That is all a compiler is, a translator for the words you wrote and it puts it through to your computer to do something.

Programming is about two things, structure (the way you must gramatically format the words you are typing) and common sense. I say common sense because if you think about what will happen with reactions from actions, you are using common sense. I put a marble on a sloped surface - the marble will roll downward. I know that common sense says gravity will make a round object roll downhill. 

Well, now lets start thinking about this like I was writing a computer program to handle a rolling marble. All you need to do is think ahead as to what we want the marble to do. You can start to block ideas like before the marble starts to roll down to raise up guards on the side, next do we want to stop the marble half way or let it go. The last part being what do I want when the marble reaches the bottom of the hill? Technically the marble is not inside a computer in my example but you can see it as symbolism.

Once you have the idea of what you want to do with the marble, how to handle situations of "if marble does (something), we need to counteract it with (something else)." That is the first step of understanding computer programming, its nothing more than figuring out if X happens do Y. Now format that in the language you are writing in and its the two parts, syntax and common sense.

Computers are devices that do nothing more than what we tell them to do. If we download or install a program, we told it that we wanted that program and it ran it. If we write code to make a marble spin on our screen, we had to just understand how to tell the computer to do stuff like draw the marble, where to place it on our screen and how fast to spin.

Programming is generally about nothing more than knowing the basics of the language you are writing in and Google/Bing for finding how to connect the parts we do know with what we need to happen. Somewhere out there you will find what is needed to fill in the blanks to your need. 

_**The dirty little secret few programmers admit is they have to use the documentation and even search engines to put parts together so the magic you love happens how they intend it to.**_

## Final Thoughts

I really did not set out to write a post this long, especially as a first post... Oh well, sometimes an idea just flies out and you run with it! I just see people all too often act like writing code for any computer language is like trying to fly with no wings. It is not magic, we just sit around thinking a lot about I wondr what will happen _if_...
