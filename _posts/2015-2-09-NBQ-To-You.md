## To give more than you take:

Is that not the best motto for anyone? I am learning that as an overall mantra in life and life is listening. Our goal in the world should be to find ways to help others and care not about our own benefits from it. 

To give is to love, and to give love is to give with open arms - but sometimes you will get PUNCHED!

I will say that because a fellow geek has been contributing like I have on some projects and working open source and yet people still badger him and complain about the choices he makes. Since when is it cool to complain about something handed to you on a silver platter?!

I move forward from that while saying I understand how that can feel sometimes, but no matter what punches come your way you learn to roll and smile when you stand back up. That is the true giving soul!

## Which way did he go?

Ever get to a point with a project and just feel like your head is turning every way but what you need it to? 

I find ideas come when they are meant to. I find something to keep my mind occupied no matter what is going on and then genious can strike!

All of this may seem like nonsense but, in the end thats all a program is - nonsense compiled and mangled into something that your computer finds makes it happy!
